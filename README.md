# max_projections

The max_projec notebook lets you automatically compute the maximum projection of confocal z-stack images (preferably tif files). It then saves the images in separate folders with or without a scalebar (several options such as size, color and position of scale bar are available). Currently it works for images containing 3 or less channels. It does not have the option to exclude channels or change the colors assigned (channel 1 will be red, channel 2 will be green, channel 3 will be blue). More coming soon.
